# Bayesian-Analysis-of-TICS-Study

For my SPH BS 849 (Bayesian Modeling for Biomedical Research & Public Health) final project, I used Bayesian modeling to analyze the Telephone Interview for Cognitive (TICS) study using [this code](https://github.com/irenehsueh49/Bayesian-Analysis-of-TICS-Study/blob/main/TICS%20Analysis.R). The given dataset had some missing observations, so [this code](https://github.com/irenehsueh49/Bayesian-Analysis-of-TICS-Study/blob/main/Complete%20Case%20Analysis.R) ran all the same analysis but only on complete cases and [this code](https://github.com/irenehsueh49/Bayesian-Analysis-of-TICS-Study/blob/main/Last%20Observation%20Carried%20Forward.R) used last observation carried forward. You can read my final report [here](https://github.com/irenehsueh49/Bayesian-Analysis-of-TICS-Study/blob/main/Bayesian%20Analysis%20of%20TICS%20Study.pdf).
